# Using Hashtags to Analysis Purpose and Technology Application of Open Source Project Related to COVID-19
## 1.Background
#####   Under the background of covid-19, many related open source projects have emerged in the open source community. We want to know:
#####   What are the main uses of these open source projects?
#####   How have the concerns of the developers changed over time?
#####   What technologies are involved in the development of these projects and how are they related?
## 2.Description
#####   "code.ipynb" Contains our data processing and analysis process, including all the code; the python package required for code running is in the "code.ipynb" Finally, you can follow the prompts to install the corresponding version of the package.
#####   "Data923.db3" is the database of the data we analyze, which is a simple SQLite3 database.
#####   The "data in the analysis process" folder contains all intermediate data generated in the process of data analysis. The process and function of each document are mentioned in the "code.ipynb".
## 3. Contributions
#####   The main contributions of this paper include the following. Analyzing the response of specific communities of practice to the pandemic will help facilitate better solutions for the community of practice in response to the COVID-19 and future pandemics. Summarizing the functionality of projects initiated by the IT community of practice during the pandemic and the technologies used will help create a larger pool of pre-existing technologies to address future crises. An examination of GitHub shows the differences in technology adoption during the pandemic between the communities of practice and the academic community. This can provide helpful insight into the rapid adoption of emerging technologies during the pandemic.
